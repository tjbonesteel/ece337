#  Filter e-mail through "procmail".
#  
#  If procmail is not found or fails for some reason, exit with status
#  75.  Status 75 tells sendmail that a temporary failure occurred and to
#  try again later.  This way, mail won't be lost so long as a correction
#  is made before sendmail gives up trying a few days later.
#  
"|/usr/local/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75"
#
#  If at some point in the future, you want to bounce messages back,
#  uncomment the lines in the ".procmailrc" file and switch the line
#  above to:
#
#	"|/usr/local/bin/procmail -f-"
